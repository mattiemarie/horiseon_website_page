The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.

## Description

The goal of the Challege 01 is to refractor the existing code. This means that the code should serve the same functionality, but present it self in a more organized and consise manner. The html and css files should also be adorned with useful notes for the coder and for future coders so that it is easier to follow.
